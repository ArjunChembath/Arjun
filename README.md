# For Whatsapp Chat Reversal

Steps for execution
1. Open Whatsapp Web in Browser.
2. Move to Console where we can provide the JS.
3. Execute the same.
4. execute fakemain().
5. execute startPolling().
6. Send a whatsapp message from any other phone to the whatsapp user opened in Whatsapp Browser.
7. Magic happens!! Without any external intervention, the text received in whatsapp web will be sent back to the external whatsapp user in rerverse.

Things to Work On:
1. Cannot handle if the message is fresh image sent from gallery.
2. If the image is forwarded, text 'forwarded' will be reversed and sent as message.
3. Even if we didnt receive a message, the message sent from whatsapp web will also be reveresed and sent again.
